# Inspirational Quote Page

My scrimba bootcamp solo project in module 2. 
I build it from scratch and use all the tricks and great practice I learned so far.
I also learned from building:
- how to setup background image perfectly
- how to make a div into a link
- how to use js to change css
Tried my best to make the page responsive, maybe should go back after learning module 4.
